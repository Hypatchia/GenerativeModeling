#### Generative Adversarial Network 

* Context :
    * Generative Networks are a class of Deep Neural Networks 
    * GANs are Composed of two competing adversaries .
    * One is called a Generator ,
    * The otehr is called a Discriminator
* Objective :
    * To simply Implement a variations of the Discriminator & generator
    * To Implement a GAN training loop as it's different for Traditional Neural Networks
* Architecture :
    * Generator
