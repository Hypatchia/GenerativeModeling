* Context :
    * The Objective is:
    * To build and train an Uncomplete AutoEncoder 
    * The Challenge is an Unsupervised-SemiSupervised Problem 
    * 17 features from the dataset were taken as a Feature Space
    * The features were compressed into a BottleNeck of 1/3 the input size and decoded
    * A decoded output is of size 17 
    * The Validation Loss was minimal
